            The <a href="http://www.softcover.io">Softcover</a> publishing plataform was designed mainly for ebooks like
            the <a href="https://railstutorial.org/book"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em>book<a>and <a
                        href="http://learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough HTML to be DAngerous</em></a>, but it;s also
                    good for makein more traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by herman Melvill;e
                    (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below a short and effectionately inrreverent
                    book report on this classic of American literature.

            by herman Melville begins with these immortal words:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago-never mind how long precesely-having little or more money
                in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and
                see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the
                circulation.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            After driving off hos splee (which <em>can't</em> be good for you), Ishmael then goes on in much the same
            vein for approximately one jillion pages. The only thing bigger then Moby Dick (who&mdash;<em>spoiler
                alert!</em>&mdash;is a giant white whale) is the book itself
